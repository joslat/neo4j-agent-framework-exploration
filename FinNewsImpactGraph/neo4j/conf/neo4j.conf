# Note on observability:
# - Neo4j query logging and metrics are primarily Enterprise features in Neo4j 5+.
# - For Community, you can still see query history in Neo4j Browser, and in apps you can log queries client-side.
# - We also include Cypher "metrics" queries in the seed/demo (node/rel counts, degree stats).
